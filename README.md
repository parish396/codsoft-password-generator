You can download it from python.org.UsageOpen your terminal or command prompt.Navigate to the directory where you saved password_generator.py.Run the script:python password_generator.py
This will generate a default 12-character password including uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.Use command-line arguments for customization:-l or --length: Specify the password length.python password_generator.py --length 16
-u or --uppercase: Include uppercase letters (default: True).-L or --lowercase: Include lowercase letters (default: True).-n or --numbers: Include numbers (default: True).-s or --symbols: Include symbols (default: False).Examples:Generate a 20-character password with only lowercase letters and numbers:python password_generator.py -l 20 -L -n
Generate a 10-character password with all character types:python password_generator.py -l 10 -u -L -n -s
